The AI engineer's trajectory shows a comprehensive development effort on a Salesforce Audit application. Initially, the focus was on core functionality: implementing an Edit Assumptions modal for ROI calculations and resolving Salesforce OAuth issues, specifically a  error. This involved significant backend adjustments in  and frontend changes in .

The project then pivoted to an extensive UI/UX overhaul, aiming for an Apple-style, ultra-clean, premium design. This iterative process applied new design tokens, typography, and spacing across the Landing Page and Dashboard. Key areas of refinement included the Dashboard's session fetching and conditional rendering, evolving button styles (from gradient to solid, black, then outline), and meticulously adjusting layout, padding, shadows, and micro-interactions (e.g., card fade-in, hover effects, button presses). The implementation of a sliding segmented control, a subtle toast notification for connection status, and a clear disconnect button further polished the user experience. The most recent efforts concentrated on perfecting the landing page's visual rhythm and the dashboard's Not Connected empty state, ensuring controls only appear when relevant and icons are refined SVGs.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is a Salesforce audit application generating clean, branded PDF reports for org inefficiencies. Initial MVP included Salesforce OAuth, basic metadata analysis, findings display, and PDF export, evolving from mock data to real Salesforce integration. A critical requirement shifted to making time and money savings calculations non-generic, org-specific, and transparent, incorporating hybrid models, department salaries, role attribution, and detailed breakdowns. Concurrently, the application underwent a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul to achieve an Apple-style, ultra-clean, premium design, featuring progressive disclosure and refined aesthetics across all pages. The app now displays audit sessions dynamically, handles Salesforce OAuth, and provides detailed audit results.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Salesforce Integration:** OAuth 2.0 (simple-salesforce, requests-oauthlib).
- **Environment Management:** Kubernetes, Supervisorctl, .env variables.
- **UI/UX Design:** Tailwind CSS, Apple-style minimalism, responsive design, micro-animations, progressive disclosure.
- **ROI Calculation:** Hybrid algorithms for time/cost savings with user-customizable assumptions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



- **/app/backend/server.py**:
    - **Importance**: The central FastAPI application handling API routes, Salesforce OAuth, MongoDB operations, and ROI calculations.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - **OAuth Flow**: Corrected the  endpoint to perform a proper HTTP 302 redirect instead of returning JSON, resolving  issues.
        - **Audit Session Retrieval**: Modified  to ensure  fields are stored as proper datetime objects instead of ISO strings, and implemented Python-side sorting for sessions in descending order by  for correct display (newest first).
        - **Data Handling**: Ensured MongoDB  conversions were handled for proper JSON serialization in API responses.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    - **Importance**: The main React component for routing, UI state, and rendering various application pages (Landing, Dashboard, Audit Results, OAuth Callback).
    - **Changes Made**:
        - **Dashboard State Management**: Introduced  hooks for , , , and  to manage UI states.
        - **Session Fetching**: Implemented a  hook to fetch audit sessions from  (corrected API endpoint from ).
        - **Conditional Rendering**: Logic updated to dynamically display an empty state card, a loading skeleton, or a grid/list of  components based on connection status and session data.
        - **UI/UX Enhancements**:
            - **Header/Top Bar**: Modified to include a  button and / status indicators, dynamically updating based on  state.
            - **Session Display**: Initially implemented pagination with a See More button, then later removed to display all sessions by default, adding an Audit History header and a functional Grid/List segmented control.
            - **OAuth Callback**: The component was redesigned from a full-screen Successfully Connected banner to a subtle, auto-dismissing Apple-style toast notification. The intermediate redirect panel was also redesigned to a floating card with a spinner.
            - **New Audit Button**: Added a New Audit button next to the Audit History header, styled as an Apple-style ghost button with a + icon and micro-interactions.
        - **Icon Integration**: Replaced various emojis with refined SVG icons for feature cards and empty states.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.css** & **/app/frontend/src/index.css**:
    - **Importance**: Defines the application's visual style, heavily influenced by Tailwind CSS and custom Apple-style design tokens.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - **Global Design System**: Defined custom CSS variables (, , , etc.) and established a clean, premium color palette (pure white, light grey, Apple Blue/Red/Green).
        - **Layout and Spacing**: Meticulously refined padding, margins, gaps (, ), and  (e.g., 20px for empty card, 16px for session cards, 6px for buttons). Extensive work on vertical rhythm on the landing page and dashboard to achieve precise Apple-like spacing and element alignment.
        - **Component Styling**:
            - **Connection Strip**: Styled with  for a frosted-glass effect, and  (black with ⚡︎) and  (red) text.
            - **Session Cards**: Implemented multi-layer  for depth, subtle  animation, and  elevation with . Enhanced date/time display with separate lines and right-alignment.
            - **Buttons**: Refined styles to differentiate between gradient CTAs (landing page) and solid black/outline buttons (dashboard). See More button underwent several iterations to achieve a pill shape. New Audit button was transformed into a ghost button with a  and  micro-interaction on press.
            - **Segmented Control**: Styled with an inline-flex container, active/inactive states, and a sliding blue bottom border.
            - **Toast Notification**: CSS for fixed positioning, frosted glass, rounded corners, Apple system colors, and  animation.
            - **OAuth Redirect Card**: Styled as a centered, floating white card with subtle shadows, Apple-style typography, and a CSS spinner.
            - **Loading Skeleton**: Added  class with  animation for visual feedback during data fetching.
            - **Iconography**: Defined styles for refined SVG icons used in feature cards and empty states (neutral tone, blue accent on hover).

<pending_tasks>
The explicit pending tasks from the initial prompt (Complete End-to-End Integration Testing and Complete the implementation of the dashboard session fetching and rendering logic, including final responsive adjustments) have been addressed through the extensive work and user confirmations. There are no remaining tasks from the original list.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on refining the Not Connected empty state of the Dashboard to align it with the Apple-style, ultra-clean, premium design philosophy.

Specifically, the user requested to:
1.  **Remove the Grid/List toggles and + New Audit button** when the user is not connected, as these controls are irrelevant without data.
2.  **Replace the existing emoji** in the empty card with a refined **SVG chart icon** to maintain design cohesion with other refined glyphs used across the application (e.g., on landing page feature cards).
3.  **Keep the Not Connected state clean**, with just the red label in the top-right, a centered empty card featuring the new SVG chart, a concise headline, and the black Connect to Salesforce button.

The AI engineer has implemented these changes in  and :
-   **Conditional Rendering:** The  (which contains both the segmented control for Grid/List view and the New Audit button) is now conditionally rendered based on the  state, ensuring it only appears when the user is authenticated.
-   **Icon Replacement:** The emoji in the empty card has been replaced with a more refined SVG chart icon, and corresponding CSS has been updated to style this new icon (e.g., setting a subtle neutral tone and a transition for color changes).

The immediate preceding action was to take a screenshot to visually verify the refined, clean empty state, confirming that the controls are hidden and the icon is updated as requested. This work ensures the disconnected experience is as polished and intuitive as the connected one, aligning with the overall Apple-grade aesthetic.
