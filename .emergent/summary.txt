The previous AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a highly iterative and user-feedback driven development process, primarily focused on transforming the Salesforce Audit application's UI/UX to an Apple-style, ultra-clean, premium standard. This involved initially integrating core functionalities like a Pre-Audit Modal and streamlining the dashboard. A significant part of the effort was dedicated to meticulously refining various UI components, notably the Choose Your Audit modal, through multiple rounds of pixel-perfect adjustments and integrating a comprehensive design system. This system centralized design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows, ensuring consistency across the Pre-Audit Modal, Landing Page, and Audit Results screen. The engineer systematically applied these design principles, verified changes with screenshots, and addressed user feedback to achieve a polished, native-feeling interface. The final task in progress is the integration of an external GitHub repository.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is a Salesforce audit application generating clean, branded PDF reports for org inefficiencies. A critical aspect is making ROI calculations transparent and org-specific, incorporating hybrid models and role-based salaries. Concurrently, the application demanded a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul to achieve an Apple-style, ultra-clean, premium design with progressive disclosure.
Specific requirements and implemented features include:
1.  **Upfront Business Information Collection**: Implementation of a Pre-Audit Modal to collect Annual Revenue and Total Employees *before* Salesforce OAuth, persisting this data.
2.  **Dashboard Streamlining**: Removal of redundant business information forms from the dashboard and updating the + New Audit button to directly open the Choose Your Audit modal.
3.  **Choose Your Audit Modal Transformation**: Redesign for an Apple-grade feel, incorporating segmented controls, progressive disclosure, refined button styling, pixel-perfect typography (SF Pro), spacing, corner radii, material blur backdrop, and micro-animations.
4.  **Landing Page Redesign**: Transformation of the hero section and feature cards to align with the new Apple-grade design system.
5.  **Audit Results Screen Overhaul**: Redesign of the display for audit findings to be clean, intuitive, and consistent with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
The overarching intent was to establish a unified design system with centralized tokens for comprehensive UI consistency.

-   **State Management**: React Context API.
-   **Data Validation**: Pydantic.
-   **Iconography**: Lucide React.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: The central FastAPI application handling API routes, Salesforce OAuth, and MongoDB operations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented  to store  and  from the frontend. The OAuth callback logic was updated to check for and redirect if  is missing, ensuring mandatory data collection. Salesforce OAuth callback URL was verified and provided to the user.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component for routing, UI state, and rendering application pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated the  using  for upfront data collection. The landing page was extensively refactored to an Apple-style hero section and responsive feature grid, replacing old  components with the new  component. The  was modified to ensure  presence. The Dashboard  was removed, and the + New Audit button now directly opens the  (renamed Choose Your Audit modal). The  was transformed into an Apple-grade sheet with , progressive disclosure, and pixel-perfect UI/UX. The  component was completely refactored to use , , and  components for a minimalist dashboard. Imports were adjusted for the new component library.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css** & **/app/frontend/src/index.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Define the application's global visual style, heavily influenced by Tailwind CSS and custom Apple-style design.
    -   **Changes Made**:  underwent extensive modifications to support the Apple-grade design across the , landing page, and Choose Your Audit modal, including backdrop blur, radii, shadows, typography, segmented control, and button styles.  was updated to define global CSS variables and typography from  and , establishing an 8px grid system and a refined, minimalist color palette. Old, conflicting landing page CSS was removed.

-   **/app/frontend/src/designTokens.js** (and later **/app/frontend/src/styles/tokens.js**):
    -   **Importance**: The centralized source of truth for all design values (colors, typography, layout).
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially created as  and later standardized into  to export , , and  objects, ensuring a single, consistent design language across the application.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/** (new directory):
    -   **Importance**: Houses reusable, token-driven React components.
    -   **Files Created/Modified**:
        -   : Exports all unified components.
        -   : Consolidated into three variants:  (gradient), , and , all adhering to Apple's button specifications (e.g., 28px height, specific paddings/borders).
        -   : A single wrapper component for all card-like elements (feature cards, audit history, findings), implementing consistent padding, border-radius, and shadows.
        -   : A unified component for form inputs and select fields, enforcing Apple-style height, borders, and placeholder text.
        -   : A unified wrapper for all modals, ensuring consistent width, padding, border-radius, and backdrop blur.
        -   : Component for displaying the audit stage summary, stats, constraints, and next steps, styled with design tokens.
        -   : Component for interactive, expandable audit finding details, including domain badges, priority pills, and cost display, adhering to the new minimalist design.
        -   : Component for domain and priority filters, using the unified input styles.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with integrating the code from the user's GitHub repository (https://github.com/jordan-shipped/Salesforce-Audi). After initial access issues (404 error, then FireCrawl polling error), the repository was made public and successfully accessed. The AI engineer has confirmed the repository's structure and has begun the process of extracting key frontend and backend files. The explicit next step taken by the AI engineer was: Ill implement the exact code from the GitHub repository. Let me get the key frontend files and then systematically replace our current implementation with the repositorys code. This indicates the current work is in the initial phase of systematically replacing the existing codebase with the content from the provided GitHub repository.

<optional_next_step>
Continue extracting key frontend and backend files from the GitHub repository and systematically replace the current application's code with them.
