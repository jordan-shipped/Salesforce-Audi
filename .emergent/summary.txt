The AI engineer's work progressed through several distinct phases. Initially, the focus was on enhancing the Salesforce Audit application by implementing an Edit Assumptions modal to allow users to customize ROI calculations. This involved significant backend modifications to  to handle custom assumptions within the complex ROI logic and frontend updates to  for the modal's integration. A major hurdle encountered and resolved was a recurring  error during Salesforce OAuth, which required careful debugging of  configuration and external Salesforce Connected App settings.

Subsequently, the project shifted entirely to an extensive UI/UX overhaul, aiming for an Apple-style, ultra-clean, premium design. This iterative process applied new design tokens, typography, and spacing across the Landing Page, Dashboard, and Audit Results. The Landing Page was made entirely above the fold with a simplified hero section. The Dashboard underwent a significant transformation to a card-centric, minimalist design, and button styling was meticulously refined, differentiating between a gradient CTA on the landing page and solid, system-native buttons on the dashboard. The immediate next step is to correctly implement the fetching and conditional rendering of audit sessions on the Dashboard to display actual data instead of an empty state.

The primary objective is to create a Salesforce audit application that identifies org inefficiencies and provides a clean, branded PDF report. Initial requirements focused on an MVP with Salesforce OAuth integration, basic metadata analysis, findings display, and PDF export. This evolved from mock data to real Salesforce integration, driven by the user's need for a fully functional Connect to Salesforce button. A critical subsequent requirement was to make the time and money savings calculations non-generic, org-specific, and transparent. This led to implementing a hybrid calculation model distinguishing one-time cleanup costs from recurring savings, leveraging department salaries, incorporating role attribution, and providing detailed breakdowns with confidence levels. The application's UI/UX also underwent a comprehensive Apple-style overhaul to achieve a premium, clean, and progressively disclosed design.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Salesforce Integration:** OAuth 2.0 (simple-salesforce, requests-oauthlib).
- **Environment Management:** Kubernetes, Supervisorctl, .env variables.
- **UI/UX Design:** Tailwind CSS, Apple-style minimalism, progressive disclosure, responsive design.
- **ROI Calculation:** Sophisticated algorithms for time/cost savings with user roles, org context, and customizable assumptions.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


- **/app/backend/server.py**:
    - **Importance**: The FastAPI backend managing API endpoints, Salesforce OAuth, MongoDB interactions, and core ROI calculations.
    - **Changes**: Iterative refinements for Salesforce OAuth (authorization URL, callback), robust MongoDB handling (session storage, audit results), and complex ROI logic. Key changes include  for detailed savings, , and enhanced analysis functions. It was modified to accept custom ROI calculation assumptions via a new API endpoint.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    - **Importance**: The main React component handling routing, UI flow, state management, and rendering of application pages.
    - **Changes**: Routes for landing, dashboard, audit results, and OAuth. Integration of Connect with Salesforce and . Extensive updates for the Edit Assumptions modal, handling its state, and triggering the new enhanced audit API call with salary data. Significant UI/UX overhaul to implement Apple-style design elements, including the 3-card summary, header removal/simplification, and conditional rendering for the Dashboard's empty state vs. session grid. It now dynamically fetches and displays audit sessions.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.css** & **/app/frontend/src/index.css**:
    - **Importance**: Defines global and component-specific styling using Tailwind CSS.
    - **Changes**: Evolution from basic styling to a sophisticated Apple-style design system. This includes defining global design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, border-radius), specific styles for the header, hero section, feature cards, and dashboard elements (connection strip, session cards, empty state). Iterative adjustments were made for padding, shadows, button styles (gradient vs. solid accent, black vs. SF-blue), and responsive breakpoints to ensure a premium, clean, and consistent look across the application. New classes like , , , , and  were introduced and refined.

<current_work>
The application currently features a fully functional Salesforce Audit MVP with real OAuth integration. The primary focus has recently been on a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, transforming the application's aesthetic to an Apple-style, ultra-clean, premium design.

**Key UI/UX Transformations:**
1.  **Global Design System**: Implemented a consistent design language with specific fonts (SF Pro stack), a clean color palette (pure white, light grey, Apple Blue/tech gradient), generous spacing, and consistent border radii across the application.
2.  **Landing Page**: Completely redesigned to be minimal and above the fold. The top header/navigation was removed, the hero section's CTA button text was simplified (Start Free Audit from ðŸš€ Start Free Audit), and spacing was adjusted to ensure all content fits within a single viewport without scrolling.
3.  **Audit Results Page**: Overhauled to a cleaner, accordion-based design (Phase 1 and part of Phase 2 of the proposed plan were completed here). The summary strip was simplified to three key cards with tech gradients on numbers, and findings were prepared for an accordion structure.
4.  **Dashboard Redesign**: Transformed to a two-section layout: a minimal Connection Status Strip (now right-aligned status only, button removed) and a Sessions Summary section.
    *   **Empty State Card**: A beautiful, centered, floating No Audit Sessions Yet card was implemented, with an icon, gradient title, descriptive text, and an integrated Connect to Salesforce button.
    *   **Button Styling Refinement**: Buttons across the dashboard (including the empty state CTA) were initially changed to SF-Blue, then refined to be solid black with white text and a subtle dark grey hover state, ensuring no gradients are used on the dashboard while the landing page retains its gradient CTA for conversion impact.
    *   **Spacing and Card Polish**: Iterative adjustments were made to padding, card dimensions, border radii (now 20px for empty card, 16px for session cards), and shadows for a more spacious, elegant, and premium feel.

**Current immediate work**: The AI engineer is in the process of wiring up the Dashboard to actually fetch and display existing audit sessions from the backend. This involves:
1.  Adding  for , , and  states in the  component.
2.  Implementing a  hook to fetch sessions from the  endpoint when the user is .
3.  Updating the JSX to conditionally render either the  (if ) or a  (if ) populated by  components.
4.  Creating the  component to properly display session details (org name, findings count, annual savings, date) with gradient text for key metrics.
5.  Adding necessary CSS for the  to ensure proper layout and styling of session cards.

The last action recorded was updating mobile responsive styles for the new session fetching structure.
